                  <h2>Project Description:</h2>
                  <p>
                    “Tinder for books”. This is a web app created using Django, that presents people with
                    a selection of books. You can like a book and save it to your profile. Also every book
                    has links to read or purchase the book. Collected data on thousands of
                    books by building a web scraping algorithm that scraped goodreads.com,
                    Google, Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and Audible. You can take a quiz that changes what
                    genre of books are being seen.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                  <p>Saving liked books to a users profile was a challenge for a while. I had to learn
                  more about the models Django used, and eventually decided to use a many to many relationship
                  model to store a users liked books.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Another challenge was figuring out how to present 12 genres in different percentages to the user, so
                  that they aren't given just one genre. I solved this by taking their "genre score" from their
                  profile and using those numbers to determine the percentages of the genres I should be showing.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
                  <p>When you can use built in models or classes to save time, so you are not reinventing
                  the wheel. Built in things work well and can be implemented however you need to.

                  <p>
                    This is a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer, that visualizes six different sorting algorithms. Those being: Bubble, Heap, Selection, Insertion, Quick, and Merge. I built this using React.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                  <p>
                    One challenge I had was figuring out how to visually move the bars while still implementing the algorithms properly. The way I decided to do this was to write the algorithms in JavaScript as normal and add the changes to an "animation" list. Then that list would get read and visualized. Each entry in the animation list included the position, color, and height the bar should be.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Another issue was visualizing all the algorithms at the same time. When displaying all six graphs they are not individual graphs, but one graph. To solve this I split up the large graph into six smaller graphs and sent those into the sorting algorithms. After receiving the animation lists from those I then made one large animation list that would perform one animation per graph at a time.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
                  <p>
                    There is always a way to solve the problem if you take a step back and be creative with the solution. I learned this from visualizing all six at the same time.

                  <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                  <p>
                    Applying the algorithms in a visual way was a challenge. For us it is easy to
                    see which squares are connected (nodes), so I had to implement a finding available
                    neighbors method for every node.

                    Making a diagram or drawing the problem out on a whiteboard will
                    help you to problem solve before actually writing the code. It will
                    allow you to work through the problem logically before coding it.

                    As a course project I created a database for minecraft. This included
                    various blocks, items, tools, and enchantments that all have relations
                    with each other. This is just a sampling of the games content as a proof
                    of concept. Not everything from the game is included and some of the
                    values for enchanting are not exact.

                    This is a recreation of the German Encryption machine from The Second World War. I had already built this in Java only using the command line for input, but as I was learning about User Interfaces I decided to make it again in python. I used PyQt5 for this project.

                  <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                  <p>
                    Having both manual encryptions, letter by letter, and automatic was a challenge at first. For the first part, they operate differently. One letter versus many. I looped through each letter and then combined the encrypted output again. This saved me many lines of code that I would've used had I written two different but identical programs.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
                  <p>
                    I had built this in command line my freshman year of college using Java. I learned that just because I had done that and knew the solution for that case, didn't mean it would translate to this new language and using a GUI. I went back to the basics of drawing out how the device worked and built up the python from there.

                    This is a recreation of the class game "Snake" using python and pygame.
                    Not only can the snake eat the food, but also a powerup that doubles
                    the food eaten and one that slows the game down for a short period of time.

                    This was my first time using the PyGame module. Learning how to
                    draw the squares and the text to the window in a way that made everything
                    look nice was a speedbump.
                    <br>
                    Another challenge was adding the different powerups. For the "slow" effect
                    I slowed the game speed for a number of seconds.

                    I was asked to design signage and handouts for a branding meeting attended by
                    Maytag, Whirlpool, KitchenAid, and Amana. The theme for this meeting was:
                    <bl> Think Differently</bl>. This included clean two-dimensional designs
                    that fit with the current trends the client was describing in the meeting.
                    Another aspect was to show a "techy" side hense the motherboard and lightbulb.
                    With the cube the idea was that you could solve the puzzle normally or you can "Think Differently"
                    and solve it another way.

                    For this project I focused on consulting with the client and drafting the ideas before developing
                    any concept fully. This way I as able to know exactly what the client wanted and the intentions behind each decision.

                     An accounting firm first reached out to me to make an advertisement
                     to be placed in the Crains Business magazine congradulating two of
                     their partners being named "The most Influential Women in Accounting".
                     Making their pictures hexigon shaped to mirror their logo was a detail they appreciated.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     I was contacted again to make a full page black and white advertisement
                     celebrating their 85th year of operations. The clients and I discussed font and text
                     placement so nothing would clash with the background.

                  <p>
                    Having a wedding during a pandemic is difficult. From wearing masks, to socially
                    distancing, to a lower capicty at the church and reception. I worked with the bride
                    to ensure that that there was proper signage for the church and reception
                    so that everyone was following policies while still feeling like the wedding
                    she always wanted. The client had given me a pallet and some general ideas
                    on what the designs should be, other than that I had free reign.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This project taught me to focus more on the concept, idea, and feeling of
                    a design and figure out how to translate that to the current situation.

                    I was asked to create RSVP cards and dinner schedules for my local post
                    of the American Legion for their Centennial Military Ball. The outlines and stars
                    resemble metal to feel more upscale. I added the stars from the American
                    flag to fit the theming of the event. I also left a space for the address stickers
                    and return labels. The times are in military time to fit the theme and
                    most of the guests are veterens and have used it extensivley.

                    My friends asked if I could design a flyer for them for their upcoming
                    school senate elections. In talking with them they liked the older style
                    Kennedy and Nixon campaign posters. I paired that style with their school colors
                    (Loyola and Purdue University).

                    During my time in my fraternity I have designed a few different shirts
                    for our formal recruitment period. These take from different eras and styles.
                    Some are fun and some are
