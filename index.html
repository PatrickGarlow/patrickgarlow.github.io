                  <h2>Project Description:</h2>
                  <p>
                    This is a web application built using django and the django rest framework for the backend and react
                    for the front end. This site is responsive and can be connected to from a mobile device.
                    The idea behind this project was to allow guests of a party to control the hosts spotify account though
                    this site allowing them to play/pause the music or skip the curent song. These controls are done using 
                    the Spotify API.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                  <p>
                  This was the first time I communicated with an API. Working through the documentation and figuring out how to recieve information
                  and sending function requests took a little bit of time to understand and implement.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
                  <p>
                    Make a mockup for different views of all the pages. This helped me plan how to style elements and plan ahead.

                  <p>
                    This is a movie recomendation website built using Django. The goal of this site was to add a new rating for
                    movies that would allow for better surprise movie recomendations. This project was a group senior capstone in which I was the
                    full stack developer.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                  <p>
                    We had trouble connecting the external database and the site. Both parties had dependencies on their machines that wouldn't allow them 
                    to communicate. We decided to put everything on a final host machine with no dependencies and got them to work together.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
                  <p>
                    Knowing how to deploy a site from the beginning helps in the long run. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Planning use cases, pages, and how algorithms will work in the planning phase really makes the construction phase much easier.

                  <p>
                    “Tinder for books”. This is a web app created using Django, that presents people with
                    a selection of books. You can like a book and save it to your profile. Every book
                    has links to read or purchase. Collected data on thousands of
                    books by building a web scraping algorithm that scraped goodreads.com,
                    Google, Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and Audible. Users can take a quiz that changes what
                    genre of books are being seen.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                  <p>Saving liked books to a users profile was a challenge for a while. I had to learn
                  more about the models Django used, and eventually decided to use a many to many relationship
                  model to store a users liked books.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Another challenge was figuring out how to present 12 genres in different percentages to the user, so
                  that they aren't given just one genre. I solved this by taking their "genre score" from their
                  profile and using those numbers to determine the percentages of the genres I should be showing.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
                  <p>When you can, use built in models or classes to save time, so you are not reinventing
                  the wheel. Built in things work well and can be implemented however you need to.

                  <h2>Project Description:</h2>
                  <p>
                    This is a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer, that visualizes six different sorting algorithms. Those being: Bubble, Heap, Selection, Insertion, Quick, and Merge. I built this using React.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                  <p>
                    One challenge I had was figuring out how to visually move the bars while still implementing the algorithms properly. The way I decided to do this was to write the algorithms in JavaScript as normal and add the changes to an "animation" list. Then that list would get read and visualized. Each entry in the animation list included the position, color, and height the bar should be.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Another issue was visualizing all the algorithms at the same time. When displaying all six graphs they are not individual graphs, but one graph. To solve this I split up the large graph into six smaller graphs and sent those into the sorting algorithms. After receiving the animation lists from those I then made one large animation list that would perform one animation per graph at a time.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
                  <p>
                    There is always a way to solve the problem if you take a step back and be creative with the solution. I learned this from visualizing all six at the same time.

                    This is a recreation of the class game "Snake" using vanilla JavaScript and HTML/CSS.
                    Every so often a special blue food will appear that will count as two foods. 
                    The player can select whatever color they want for the snake to be.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                  <p>
                    Overall this was a relatively easy project. The only thing that took me a second to figure out was how to change the color of the snake
                    when the player selects a color. To do this I used radio buttons and when the player was ready to start the game it looked to see which radio
                    button was selected, and used that value.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Applying the algorithms in a visual way was a challenge. For us it is easy to
                    see which squares are connected (nodes), so I had to implement a finding available
                    neighbors method for every node.

                  <p>
                    As a course project I created a database for Minecraft. This included
                    various blocks, items, tools, and enchantments that all have relations
                    with each other. This is just a sampling of the games content as a proof
                    of concept. Not everything from the game is included and some of the
                    values for enchanting are not exact.

                    This is a recreation of the German Encryption machine from The Second World War. I had already built this in Java only using the command line for input, but as I was learning about User Interfaces I decided to make it again in python. I used PyQt5 for this project.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                  <p>
                    Having both manual encryptions, letter by letter, and automatic was a challenge at first. For the first part, they operate differently. One letter versus many. I looped through each letter and then combined the encrypted output again. This saved me many lines of code that I would've used had I written two different but identical programs.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
                  <p>
                    I had built this in command line my freshman year of college using Java. I learned that just because I had done that and knew the solution for that case, didn't mean it would translate to this new language and using a GUI. I went back to the basics of drawing out how the device worked and built up the python from there.

                    I was asked to design signage and handouts for a branding meeting attended by
                    Maytag, Whirlpool, KitchenAid, and Amana. The theme for this meeting was:
                    <bl> Think Differently</bl>. This included clean two-dimensional designs
                    that fit with the current trends the client was describing in the meeting.
                    Another aspect was to show a "techy" side hence the motherboard and lightbulb.
                    With the cube the idea was that you could solve the puzzle normally or you can "Think Differently"
                    and solve it another way.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For this project I focused on consulting with the client and drafting the ideas before developing
                    any concept fully. This way I as able to know exactly what the client wanted and the intentions behind each decision.

                     An accounting firm first reached out to me to make an advertisement

                     their partners being named "The most Influential Women in Accounting".
                     Making their pictures hexagon shaped to mirror their logo was a detail they appreciated.

                     I was contacted again to make a full page black and white advertisement
                     celebrating their 85th year of operations. The clients and I discussed font and text
                     placement so nothing would clash with the background.

                    Having a wedding during a pandemic is difficult. From wearing masks, to socially
                    distancing, to a lower capacity at the church and reception. I worked with the bride
                    to ensure that that there was proper signage for the church and reception
                    so that everyone was following policies while still feeling like the wedding
                    she always wanted. The client had given me a pallet and some general ideas
                    on what the designs should be, other than that I had free reign.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This project taught me to focus more on the concept, idea, and feeling of
                    a design and figure out how to translate that to the current situation.

                    of the American Legion for their Centennial Military Ball. The outlines and stars
                    resemble metal to feel more upscale. I added the stars from the American
                    flag to fit the theming of the event. I also left a space for the address stickers
                    and return labels. The times are in military time to fit the theme and
                    most of the guests are veterans and have used it extensively.
